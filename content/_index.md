# Observations of a Rapidly Pulsating Radio Source

A. Hewish, J. Bell (now Bell Burnell), et al

---

## What they were looking for:

Quasars. 

How?

_Interplanetary scintillations_

---

## How this works:

## In July, 1967...

- The radio survey began
- Bell discovered weak, periodic radio signals in the data
- Signals were initially believed to be interference
- However, signals were localized to a fixed position on the sky
- In November, investigations began to understand the signals' cause

## What did they look like?

---

## What properties did they have?

- Periodic
- Time variation in amplitude
- Dispersed

## Estimates of periodicity

- Observed period of  {{< latex "1.33733 \pm 0.00001" >}}
- Done with 6 hour time window
- Using measurements taken over a months and correcting for Earth's motion, get {{< latex "1.3372795 \pm 0.0000020" >}}

---

## Estimates of Dispersion

- First used two identical receivers tuned to 80.5 MHz and 81.5 MHz
 - from this they find delay in the lower frequency of 0.2 seconds, or a shift of - 5 MHz/second
- Second method used extra length of cable for half of the receiver
 - causes frequency-dependent phase; receiver oscillates with a period related to the change in frequency over time
 - using this method, get {{< latex "- 4.9 \pm 0.5" >}} MHz/second

## Why does it vary?

- Planetary scintillation could contribute
 - but not sufficient to explain short-timescale (minutes) variation
- No clear correlations or systematic variations

---

## Nature of the Source

- Aliens???
 - while Bell and Hewish considered it, they abandoned this idea after more than one source observed far apart in the sky
- No parallax greater than 2 arcmin
 - source at distance of at least {{< latex "10^3" >}} AU
 - energy at least {{ latex "10^{17}" >}} ergs (assuming isotropic source)

---

## Nature of the Source

- From bandwidth and dispersion, can constrain the pulse time and thus the source size
 - get 4800 km as maximum size
- Get upper limit on distance to source from dispersion
 - 65 pc

---

## Summing it up

- Local objects (galactic)
- Energetic
- Compact
- Localized tightly in right ascension, but not in declination
 - Made optical follow-ups difficult

---

## Speculation in this paper

- Regularity of the period suggests entire object involved, not just fluctuation of a feature 
 - (e.g. disturbance in stellar atmosphere)
- Bell and Hewish suggest radial pulsation of compact stars (due to work by Meltzer and Thorne)
 - White dwarf periods pose problems (fundamental mode too low in frequency), neutron stars are compatible

---

## What followed Hewish, Bell, et al

- Many detections followed
- Thorne and Ipser (1968) argue against radial pulsation of neutron stars, argue for white dwarfs
- Gold publishes paper barely longer than a page, detailing model of rotating neutron star
 - emission via relativistic rotating magnetic plasma

## Rotating Neutron Stars

### Crab pulsar discovered optically, period too small for other proposed mechanisms

Original crab pulsar sources detected by Staelin and Reifenstein (1968)

Richard Lovelace and collaborators localized these sources using Arecibo.
